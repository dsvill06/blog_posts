summary: Listing out the wants and goals I have for this blog as well as what i'm learning

# Welcome
This blog started out as a simple test to see if I could get an idea to work but now I feel that I can use it to lay out my thoughts and goals out. I have taken the past few weeks to explore different topics such as:
* Quantum Computing
* Mechatronics
* Control Systems
* Microcontrollers
* Computer Architecture and System Design
* Machine Learning
* Etc.
A lot yes, but I was trying to explore a little bit more in various fields to narrow down my interests within computer science and what I am capable of working on. One thing that I did find interest in is more of the computer engineering topics and those that involve some form of a physical components which leads to my next topic.
